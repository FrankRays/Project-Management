Project-Management
==================

Online Project Management System

This is for a school project with very limited resources especially time.
The whole thing should be done in far less than 100 hours (it's probably going to be closer to 25) so don't expect anything fancy.
Main Programming Language is going to be php, some javascript/ajax is probably going to follow eventually.

Purpose: online project management to manage resources and work units. Obviously it's possible that it will get expanded beyond that.
